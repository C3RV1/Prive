# Prive
Online service where you can save your rsa keys without risks.

# How to run locally

First of all, download the source code from a stable release or stable pre-release from the Releases section and extract it.

Next, run `python setup.py install` to install PriveAPI. When a new PriveAPI version gets released, it will be in the **Release Notes** of the release.

## To start the server

To start the server run `python init.py` in the `server` folder. You can tweak and play around with the values in `config.py` to change the behaviour of the server.

## To test it

There is a simple script to test the client and API in the `tests` folder. The script is named `clientTestAPI.py`.

# Finally
Any suggestion about how to improve the project would be very appreciated and helpful.
