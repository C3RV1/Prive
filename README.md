# Prive
Online service where you can save your rsa keys without risks.

# How to run locally

**Note: Prive must be run using Python 2.7**

First of all, download the source code from a stable release, stable pre-release or stable nighty from the Releases section and extract it. You should not download it from the master branch.

Next, you may run `python setup.py install` to install `PriveAPI` and `pycryptodome`. When a new PriveAPI version gets released, it will be in the **Release Notes** of the release.

## To start the server

To start the server run `python init.py` in the `server` folder. You may want to tweak and play around with the values in `config.py` to change the behaviour of the server. The first time you start the server it will create a rsa key pair and store the public key and the private key in `<DatabasePath>/publicKey.pk` and `<DatabasePath>/privateKey.skm`. `<DatabasePath>` may be changed in `config.py` to any other directory.

## To test it

First of all, you must rename the `publicKey.pk` generated by the server to the name specified in the constructor of the `PriveAPIInstance` object. This value is `serverPublicKey.pk` by default. It may be changed to any other path of the system.

There is a simple script to test the client and API in the `tests` folder. The script is named `clientTestAPI.py`.

# Finally
Any suggestion about how to improve the project would be very appreciated and helpful.
